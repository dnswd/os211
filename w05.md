# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Abusing Virtual Memory to Exploit a Design Flaw in Intel Chips](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/windows-exploitation-tricks-trapping.html)<br>
This Project Zero artcile demonstrated a way to read priveledged memory location
by abusing Virtual Memory on Windows Machine. The article explains very
thoroughly how the exploit works and how it was first discovered, and how it can
be abused. A really interesting article about how virtual memory can be used to
penetrate a flaw in a computer processor. 

2. [OS: Tuning Manajemen Memory](https://lms.onnocenter.or.id/wiki/index.php/OS:_Tuning_Manajemen_Memory)<br>
This is an Indonesian article written by the one and only Mr. Onno. Explains how
memory management works and how to properly tune it. Mr. Onno explained in the
article about things to avoid, this we can utilize to be more efficient in
memory usage, and such. I really recommend you to read this if you have no idea
what this week is talking about.

3. [Virtual Memory Emulator](https://github.com/DavidLJaqua/Virtual-Memory-Emulator)<br>
A virtual memory emulator written in Java. It simulates this functionality of 
virtual memory using a few components such as a TLB lookup table, a page table,
physical memory for storing loaded frames from disk, and finally an address
reader. 

4. [Exploring virtual memory with `vmstat`](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-commands-vmstat)<br>
`vmstat`, short for Virtual Memory Statistics Reporter, is a tool to helps you
explore the contents of your vitual memory. Things like memory, paging, 
processes, IO, CPU, and disk scheduling are all included in the array of 
information provided. This article will help you learn more about `vmstat`.

5. [The Cost of Software-Based Memory Management Without Virtual Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06789)<br>
The costs of virtual memory have increased significantly. With large memory 
workloads, virtualized environments, data center computing, and chips with 
multiple DMA devices, virtual memory can degrade performance and increase power 
usage. This paper investigates the issue and explored ways to improve software
performance.

6. [How to use shared memory with Linux in C](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5656530/how-to-use-shared-memory-with-linux-in-c)<br>
This discussion discussed how to use shared memory with C using `shmget` amd 
`mmap`. People also give code snippets/examples on how hared memory can be
implemented using both approach.

9. [Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9)<br>
Mauris urna libero, varius in purus nec, tempor pharetra lorem.
Vivamus lorem nisi, mattis ut tellus at, tincidunt cursus libero.
Curabitur vehicula placerat neque eget iaculis.
Nulla facilisi.
Cras condimentum leo a libero cursus lacinia.

10. [Ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10)<br>
Nunc imperdiet gravida lorem vitae tincidunt. 
Phasellus tristique nulla at justo finibus pulvinar.
Phasellus in leo vitae sem congue sollicitudin eu sed risus.
Aliquam erat volutpat.
Proin in erat fringilla, pulvinar nisl quis, vulputate purus.
