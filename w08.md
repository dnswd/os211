# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [What is Multiple Processor Scheduling in OS?](https://binaryterms.com/multiple-processor-scheduling.html)<br>
This article explains about the basic concept of multiprocessor scheduling and
explains how there's no best best solution for multiprocessor scheduling. The
article explains the topic very clearly and I recommend you to read it.

2. [Real-time Operating System Scheduling Algorithms](https://open4tech.com/rtos-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
This article explains about popular scheduling algorithm and explains about the
advantage and disadvantages of each algorithm. This article also introduce two
type of scheduling algorithms: Preemptive and Non-preemtive scheduling.

3. [Thread Scheduling for Multi-Core Platforms (Paper)](http://static.usenix.org/event/hotos07/tech/full_papers/rajagopalan/rajagopalan.pdf)<br>
In this paper, the author introduce a scheduling framework for multi-core
systems. The scheduling framework used in this paper have a pretty decent 
performance but also without compromising ease of programming. Neat thing to
read.

4. [Managing Process Affinity in Linux](https://www.glennklockwood.com/hpc-howtos/process-affinity.html)<br>i
Linux has a very good thread scheduler. But in High Performance Computing, 
relying on linux thread scheduler isn't enough. most HPC applications benefit 
greatly from a little bit of help in manually placing threads on different 
processor cores. This article briefly explains how you can achieve that.

5. [Hardened Linux From Scratch (HLFS)](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hlfs/)<br>
Hardened Linux From Scratch (HLFS) is a project similar to LFS but hardened for 
security. The guide goes to some extremes to lock down known and unknown 
security threats, including patching the core toolchain to prevent buffer 
overflows.

6. [LFS Speedrun](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/04/11/pengrun/)  
Internet never cease to amaze me with absurd ideas. Here is the proposal for
a competition of the fastest LFS build in the world. So far there's only one
entry that took four hours to complete.

7. [OS: Complete Teori Tuning Kernel Scheduler](https://lms.onnocenter.or.id/wiki/index.php/OS:_Complete_Teori_Tuning_Kernel_Scheduler)<br>
Got stuck with this week's material? Mr. Onno to the rescue! Here he explains
about tuning schedulers and explains how Linux's scheduler works. Neat to read
as always. Thank you Mr. Onno!

8. [Task Scheduling in Clusters](https://www.massey.ac.nz/~mjjohnso/notes/59735/seminars/04244354.pdf)<br>
This report talks about scaling a task scheduler with a cluster of machines. 
This is a very neat report and this might have something to do with how 
Kubernetes handle multiple machines at OS level.

9. [Is it possible to monitor how a process is scheduled real-time with Linux?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42571692)<br>
Yes! You can see your task being scheduled in a CPU core! We can achieve this by
using Kernel Event Tracers on Linux such as `perf-sched` and `trace-cmd`. Neat! 

10. [Linux From Script](https://www.lfscript.org/wiki/Main_Page)<br>
An unofficial alternative for Automated Linux From Scratch (ALFS) that lets you
automate your LFS build. The script itself is generated from LFS and BLFS book
so you can customize the script on your own in nayway you want.

That's all for today folks.
