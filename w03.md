# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Linux File Permission Cheatsheet (Cheatsheet)](://kimconnect.com/unix-linux-file-permissions-cheat-sheet/)<br>
I, personally, still can't quite grasp the idea of file permissions in Linux. This cheatsheet helps
me know which permission do I need and how I mix them in octal. This is a must-have bookmark if you
still unfamiliar with Linux permission like me.

2. [Introduction to Archive Formats and File Compression on Linux (Article & Video)](https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/22-common-archive-and-compression-formats)<br>
This article talks about the difference between `tar`, `gzip`, `xz`, `bzip2`
, and how to use them. The article also explains steps to use them from 
creating an archive, ocmpressing it, and deflating the compressed archive. 
Very useful.

3. [Disk Formats and When to Use Them (Article)](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-format-disk)<br>
Difference between different Disk Formats and which OS supports them.
This article also explains about partition checking, formatting disks
on linux, and mounting disks on Linux.

4. [Generic print on *nix machines (Repo)](https://github.com/exebook/generic-print)<br>
This project allows you to use generic `print` program in linux machine. This is practically useful
if you already familiar with Python's `print()` or JS's `console.log()`, the source code is 
available for you to learn how `printf` or `fprintf` works. This can also be used to simplify your
work if you still don't have courage to use print commands on Linux. 

5. [Awesome FUSE Filesystem (Repo)](https://github.com/koding/awesome-fuse-fs)<br>
This is a list of resources related to FUSE file systems. From articles, libraries, language
implementations, and other kind of things related to FUSE Filesystem. This might be useful as a 
fitire reference for later OS211 weeks.

6. [Develop your own filesystem with FUSE -- No kernel programming required (Article)](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/linux/articles/l-fuse/)<br>
This srticle shows you how to unpack, build, build, and install your own Filesystem. The article
also shows you how to customize the filesystem, in this case the article uses AFS (Andrew
Filesystem) as an example. This article is short and dense, but it's so informative and
straightforward.

7. [Fantastic Dotfiles and How to Utilize Them (Article)](https://dev.to/michaelcurrin/dotfiles-to-make-your-shell-awesome-1pa1)<br>
This series of article explains about dotfiles on unix systems and how to utilize them to increase
productivity and making you comfortable using your "tools-of-choices". The article has 6 
sub-articles that dives deep into usage of these hidden files. From your shell configuration,
aliases, git, even vim. 

8. [Maximizing Disk Cache Performance for Speeed (QnA)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/41831)<br>
This is possible quite dangerous as it is more likely to lose data. But this is interesting on how
we can load parts of the kernel and the system into the RAM and maximize your machine's speed.
Impractical, but curious. *wHo nEeDs aN sSd aNywAy*.

9. [Linux Filesystems - Optimized for Humans (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFIoRLqhFpo)<br>
This video explains very well about linux filesystem. The video creator also keeping the video
friendly for windows user migrating to linux. This video should be part of OS211 because he
explains linux filesystem very well, especially since most of the students are Windows users.

10. [fscrypt - securing your machine with filesystem-level encryption](https://tlbdk.github.io/ubuntu/2018/10/22/fscrypt.html)<br>
Linux apparently have built-in filesystem **built-in into the Linux kernel**. How cool is that!?
In case you don't know how this is important, fscrypt allows you to locks a folder or veen a drive
with a passphrase. The content inside the locked drive/folder are encrypted so it stays secure.
Similar to [Window's Bitlocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview) and [Veracrypt](https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt). This is so cool and useful!
