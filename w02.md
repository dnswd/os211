# Top 10 List of Week 02
This list was written without particular order. I enjoy love this week's topic because it and covers the most important aspect of building an OS! here's Top 10 list of Week 02:

1. [The Zoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/tree/master/malwares/Source/Original)<br>
The Zoo is a collection of *almost* every malware (including RATs) that cause significant
impact on real-world. Some of them has their source code leaked and then archived into The Zoo with intention to
teach people about malware analysis and how malware works, so we can prevent similar vector occured in the future. 

2. [Writing a Simple Buffer Overflow Exploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS2O75H57qU)<br>
This is a live demonstration of Buffer Overflow exploit. 
On the OSC10 Ch. 16, the book mentions about Code Injection with Buffer Overflow. 
I found this very interesting because BOF (Buffer Overflow) are common in low-level language 
such as C, which is a language we're learning from the demo scripts this week.

3. [Intorduction to PGP and how it works](openp://users.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/630-f04/PGP-intro.html)<br>
This site explains what is PGP, the original encryption software written by Phillip Zimmermann which 
is the bases of now known GnuPG and openPGP. It explains how PGP works, how it stores data, and how it
achieve end-to-end encryption.
