# Top 10 List of Week 02
This list was written without particular order. I enjoy love this week's topic because
it and covers the most important aspect of building an OS! here's my Top 10 list of Week 02:

1. [The Zoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/tree/master/malwares/Source/Original)<br>
The Zoo is a collection of *almost* every malware (including RATs) that cause significant
impact on real-world. Some of them has their source code leaked and then archived into The Zoo with intention to
teach people about malware analysis and how malware works, so we can prevent similar vector occured in the future. 

2. [Writing a Simple Buffer Overflow Exploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS2O75H57qU)<br>
This video is a live demonstration of Buffer Overflow exploit. 
On the OSC10 Ch. 16, the book mentions about Code Injection with Buffer Overflow. 
I found this very interesting because BOF (Buffer Overflow) are common in low-level language 
such as C, which is a language we're learning from the demo scripts this week.

3. [Intorduction to PGP and how it works](openp://users.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/630-f04/PGP-intro.html)<br>
This site explains how PGP works, how it stores data, and how it achieve *end-to-end* encryption. PGP was apparently
invented by Phillip Zimmermann and an inspiration for current implementation openPGP and later well-known GnuPG.

4. [Negative Rings and Protectiong Rings with Virtualization](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/129098/what-is-protection-ring-1)
The article explains how Hypervisors utilize Protection Ring to make the guest OS *think* they have ring 0 priveledge on x86.
This article also explains the meaning of *negative* rings (Ring -1, Ring -2, Ring -3) which are invisible to the OS itself. 

5. [The International Obfuscated C Code Contest](https://www.ioccc.org/index.html)
The IOCCC is a programming contest to build the most obscure C code as possible while maintaining code functionality.
One of my favorite contestant is Yusuke Endoh with his famous [ASCII Fluid Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMYfkOtYYlg).
His code is so obscure yet it simulates fluid dynamics in ascii code very well, and not to mention that [IT'S A QUINE](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quine_(computing))!!!
HOW IN THE WORLD DOES HE COME UP WITH SUCH CODE.

(more incoming!)
