# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Missing Semester: Shell](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/)  
   This is a very helpful guide for a beginner for getting started into shell. This course various and essential topic such as navigation, pattern matching, pipelining, appending, etc etc.. I nearned the `sed`, `awk`, pipelining from this course. The course as whole is also interesting since it covers basics about operating computer for computer science students. Very helpful and interesting. 

2. [Missing Semester: Shell Scripting](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/)  
   This link also came from the same course, but this chapter specifically covers about bash scripting and automation. It seems more versatile than Windows's Batch scripting. I've done scripting myself using windows batch but bash seems to be more versatile. And the fact that it's so powerful yet built-in from the OS, is very neat. I really recommend checking this course. Very interesting and insightful!

3. [10 simple Linux tips which save 50% of my time in the command line - DEV Community](https://dev.to/javinpaul/10-simple-linux-tips-which-save-50-of-my-time-in-the-command-line-4moo)  
   This article cover various shorthand for using the shell. I learned various shothands such as `!` operator, and `cd ---` to easily navigate using the shell. Here's some notes about the `!` operator:
   
   ```bash
   dnswd@osp:~$ echo a b c d
   # !$    The last argument: d
   # !*    All of the argument: a b c d
   # !^    The first argument: a
   # !:2   The second argument: b 
   # !:2-3 The arguments from second to third one: b c
   # !:2-$ The arguments from second the last one: b c s
   # !!    Run all the previous command
   dnswd@osp:~$ apt install vim
   E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
   E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
   dnswd@osp:~$ sudo !!
   # Runs smoothly
   ```
   I would recommend this article to new Linux users. There commands is very interesting and ceertainly helpful to increase productivity.

4. [Introduction to Linux by The Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/)  
   It's an introductory course to Linux built by The Linux Foundation itself. And it's free too! Slightly more advanced from the Missing semester. It covers from Linux Basics, the Bash Shell, Network Operations, up to Local Security Principles. This will come in handy for future reference. This will come handy in the future, very interesting.

5. [Kernel Oops!](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Linux_kernel_oops)  
   This term is very new in my head since the only thing I know is Kernel Panic. So to explain it briefly, Kernel Oops is is term for any deviation from proper kernel fuctionality. This means Kernel Panic is actually a subset of Kernel Oops, which totally makes sense in my head. I always thought Linux is so strange because Kernel Panic can happen without warning and always be dangerous if it happens, as if there's some kind of single-point-of-failure inside the kernel. But Kernel Oops explains why Linux is not so unstable and it makes perfect sense. that's why this is so interesting.  

6. [Use `su -` instead of `su`](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/command-usermod-not-found-385901/#post1967095)  
   Actuyally, depends on what are you going to do next, because `su` with the option " -" gives you the full path root would have when logging in to the system after startup. regular `su` wouldn't do such thing. So you can't, for example, add new user to the sudoer group. This little stuff of knowldge nugget is important and I haven't think about it until someone mentioned why he can't add user to sudoer group in his osp machine on OS211 Discord.

7. [GitHub's pull request is bad, according to Linus Trovalds](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17)  
   Apparently GitHub-generated Pull Requests ignores useful messages and such kind of message is important to enterprise developer such as Linus Trovalds himself. Here, Mr. Trovalds ~~rants~~ ~~roasts~~ argue about the importance of such info which makes me think twice about using github as a developer. Long commit messages can be useful to give you context about development progress, what to do, what to expect, and how did I initially use that particular solution. Such information can be useful various case such as: you are trying to get *in the moment* after long vacation or someone else is going to maintain the project. Very interesting thought, and I agree on some of his points. At the time I'm writing is post, I'm not advanced anough to understand his other points.

8. [Git have aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)  
   Git have aliases to shorten yout commands! This is interesting and useful! Not all machine have aliases so it is helpful to have one built-in into the program itself. A few aliases I found was `git undo`, it lets you undo the most recent commit just in case you can't amend it. You can register `git undo` using `git config --global alias.undo 'reset HEAD~'`. So instead of typing `git reset HEAD~` i just can type `git undo`.

9. [Yet Anoter Vi Implementation -- NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)  
   I learned about `vi`, I learned about `vim` and `vimtutor`. Now I learned that NeoVim exists. It supposed to be a better version of vim because apparently vim's codebase is really really messy because all the contributions, features, bugfixes have to be commited [by one person](https://github.com/vim/vim/commits/master). it is really difficult for people to fork it or extend it themselves if they want to build something around vim. This is where NeoVim comes in. NeoVim supopsed to be a refactored version of Vim. Since the NeoVim's codebase is a lot cleaner than Vim, it has a lot of plugins, API, and features for people to toy around while still have the regular Vim functionality. NeoVim also have more default values than Vim in order to make new use rmore comfortable at changing settings on NeoVim. NeoVim sounds just like a cooler version of Vim, same but better. That's why NeoVim is so interesting for me.

10. [SSH Config Files](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/config/)  
    SSH Config files are useful very useful if you don't want to type a long `ssh` command to use advanced options of SSH. SSH Configs also allows you to be more flexible and you can using SSH as your wish. For example: If you want to connact from A to C trough B while you require an identity file to access B, you can't use the online ssh command to do that, because if you just use the `-i` parameter, ssh will use the identity file to connect with C, not B. But you can do that with SSH Configs using `ForwardAgent` and `ProxyJump` option. It is very useful and interesting for me, and you might want to use it too.
