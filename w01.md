# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Missing Semester: Shell](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/)
   
   This is a very helpful guide for a beginner for getting started into shell. Navigating, pattern matching, pipelining, appending, etc etc.. Very neat.

2. [Missing Semester: Shell Scripting](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/)
   
   Apparently I learned that you can make scripts using shell scripting. Knowing it comes with the OS itself, it's very neat. It seems more versatile than Windows's Batch scripting.

3. [10 simple Linux tips which save 50% of my time in the command line - DEV Community](https://dev.to/javinpaul/10-simple-linux-tips-which-save-50-of-my-time-in-the-command-line-4moo)
   
   I learned ver shothands such as `!` operator, and `cd ---` to easily navigate using the shell. Here's some notes about the `!` operator:
   
   ```bash
   dnswd@osp:~$ echo a b c d
   # !$    The last argument: d
   # !*    All of the argument: a b c d
   # !^    The first argument: a
   # !:2   The second argument: b 
   # !:2-3 The arguments from second to third one: b c
   # !:2-$ The arguments from second the last one: b c s
   # !!    Run all the previous command
   dnswd@osp:~$ apt install vim
   E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
   E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
   dnswd@osp:~$ sudo !!
   # Runs smoothly?
   ```

(others coming soon!)
