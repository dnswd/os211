# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Writing and Using Shared Libraries (Article)](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=22424)<br>
This article shows you steps to build a shared libraries and how to incorporate
them into your machine. The article starts at explaining about how shared
library differs form static library. It is worth mentioning that shared library 
is not dependent on the address because the functions inside the shared library 
may be stored in different address. To mitigate that issue, try to use `-fPIC` 
flag when compiling codes that will use the shared library.

2. [How Static and Dynamic Libraries affect Memory Usage (Paper)](https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/127837.pdf)<br>
This master thesis talks about the difference between Static Libraries and 
Dynamic Libraries, and how both affect memory usage in a machine. The test was 
conducted on IP-STB embedded system, and was conducted to give quantitative 
analysis of how each Library use the memory and how it impact system 
performance. This is a very interesting read, I'd recommend you to read this. 

3. [Why microprocessors prefer Little Endian (Article)](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-big-and-little-endian-byte-order/)<br>
There's a reason why microprocessors use little endian while networking protocol
uses big endian. This article explains briefly the advantages of both formats 
and why both have their own places. Endian issues are an example of general
encoding problem, basically. 

4. [How to manage memory with malloc, calloc, realloc, and free in C (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQP4X3odvHE)<br>
This video explains about memory management with `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`,
and `free`. I love the way he explains with a sample code. You can try to run
the sample code if you want to try it yourself. After all, learning by doing is
always better imo. Go give it a try

5. [What does the malloc do? (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPDBOhiKaD8)<br>
Malloc is one of the *magic* function of the C language. This video explains 
thoroughly about how malloc works and how it finds new memory locations. The 
video starts on explaining a few C functions, and then proceed to explain how
malloc utilize those lower function as if it's doing some sort of sorcery. 

6. [Pointers in C(++) (Video)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6)<br>
The video explains a lot about pointers. In my opinion, the explanation is very 
clear that I think I understand what pointers are. The video also poke around
double pointers and how they reference double pointers. This video uses C++ for
demonstration, but I think pointers on C++ and C are identical, and both
language uses the saame concept to implement pointers.

Donec non mauris tincidunt, aliquam lorem eget, porta odio.
Maecenas ac arcu urna.
Cras congue tellus lacus.

9. [Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9)<br>
Mauris urna libero, varius in purus nec, tempor pharetra lorem.
Vivamus lorem nisi, mattis ut tellus at, tincidunt cursus libero.
Curabitur vehicula placerat neque eget iaculis.
Nulla facilisi.
Cras condimentum leo a libero cursus lacinia.

10. [Ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10)<br>
Nunc imperdiet gravida lorem vitae tincidunt. 
Phasellus tristique nulla at justo finibus pulvinar.
Phasellus in leo vitae sem congue sollicitudin eu sed risus.
Aliquam erat volutpat.
Proin in erat fringilla, pulvinar nisl quis, vulputate purus.
